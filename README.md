**Parameters**

Array

**Returns**

Array

Problems
-
How to address the colorized text, symbols for gameplay, board setup. Then refactoring for other game options.

What I used
-
Just arrays, really, for the functionality. Removing variables after they'd been checked. Sample 4 times to get the random code.

What I learned
-
That there are different levels of duplication and cloning is important.
